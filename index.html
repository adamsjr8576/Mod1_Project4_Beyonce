        The player that finds the greatest numbers of pairs, wins.</p>
        <p class="instruction-section-paragraph">To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card in the card
        pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of Beyonce. Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will
        have completed a match! If they don't, you'll have three seconds to look at them before they flip back over. Then it's time
        for the other player to try!</p>
        <p class="instruction-section-paragraph">After youy play, you'll see the name of the final winnner and how long it took to
        win the game.</p>
